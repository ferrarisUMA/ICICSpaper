Abstract. In the Internet of Things (IoT) there are ecosystems where
their physical ’smart’ entities virtually interact with each other. Often,
this interaction occurs among unknown entities, making trust an essential
requirement to overcome uncertainty in several aspects of this interaction.
However, trust is a complex concept, and incorporating it in IoT is
still a challenging topic. For this reason, it is highly significant to specify
and model trust in early stages of the System Development Life Cycle
(SDLC) of IoT-integrated systems, thus enhancing the aforementioned
task. TrUStAPIS is a requirements engineering methodology recently introduced
for incorporating trust requirements during IoT-based system
design. The scope of this paper is to provide an extension of TrUStAPIS
by introducing IoT trust semantics compatible with the W3C Web of
Things (WoT) recommendations generated with the assistance of Large
Language Models (LLMs). Taking advantage of LLMs as a tool for integrating
and refining existing methodologies, in this paper we present our
work towards a revision of the TrUStAPIS methodology. In this work,
we contribute a new conceptual model and a refined JSON-LD ontology
that takes into account IoT trust semantics, providing eventually a valuable
tool for software engineers to design and model IoT-based systems
and services.
